## Data Collection:
You're already collecting data from an API using the ImageFetcher class. You could extend this to fetch data from multiple APIs, or from different endpoints of the same API. You could also implement pagination to fetch multiple pages of data.

## Data Transformation:
After collecting the data, you often need to transform it into a format that's easier to work with. In your current code, you're already doing some transformation when you extract the image ID, description, and response from the API data. You could extend this to include more complex transformations, like cleaning the data (e.g., handling missing values), extracting additional features (e.g., extracting color information from the images), or aggregating the data (e.g., counting the number of images for each description).

## Data Storage:
Once you have collected and transformed the data, you need to store it in a way that's efficient to query and analyze. Right now, you're storing the images as local files, which is a form of unstructured data storage. You could extend this to include structured data storage, like storing the image metadata (ID, description, filename) in a database. You could use a SQL database like SQLite or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, depending on your needs.

## Data Retrieval:
After storing the data, you need to be able to retrieve it efficiently. If you implement the database storage suggested above, you could add methods to your classes to query the database. For example, you could add a method to the ImageSaver class to retrieve all images with a certain description.

## Data Pipeline:
Data engineering often involves building data pipelines, which are automated processes for data collection, transformation, storage, and retrieval. You could turn your current script into a data pipeline by running it on a schedule (e.g., fetching new images every day), and adding error handling and logging to make sure the pipeline runs smoothly.

## Testing:
It's important to ensure that your code works correctly, especially when it's part of a data pipeline that runs automatically. You could add unit tests for your classes and methods to make sure they work as expected.

# DATA ENGI

Add a function to calculate how much each person owes or is owed: This function could iterate over the transactions DataFrame and calculate the total amount each person owes or is owed based on the transactions they are involved in.

Add support for uneven splits: Right now, each transaction is split evenly among the beneficiaries. You could add support for uneven splits by modifying the add_transaction function to accept a dictionary that maps each beneficiary to their share of the transaction.

Add a function to settle debts: This function could calculate the simplest way to settle all debts, so that the minimum number of payments are made.

Add support for different currencies: Right now, all transactions are in the same currency. You could add support for different currencies by adding a currency field to each transaction and using an API to convert between currencies when calculating how much each person owes or is owed.

Add a user interface: Right now, the code is run from the command line. You could add a user interface that allows users to add transactions, view the transactions DataFrame, and calculate how much each person owes or is owed.

Add persistence: Right now, the transactions are stored in memory and are lost when the program exits. You could add persistence by storing the transactions in a database or a file.

Add error handling: Right now, the code does not handle errors. You could add error handling to ensure that the program does not crash if an error occurs. For example, you could check that the total of a transaction is a positive number, and that the beneficiaries are valid Person objects.
